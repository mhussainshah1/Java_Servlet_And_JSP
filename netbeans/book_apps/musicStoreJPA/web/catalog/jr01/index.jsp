    <p class="clear_both">
    The debut album from Joe Rut rambles from Byrds-esque folk pop of "Filter" to
    the country sounds of "Find My Way Marie" to psychedelic Brit-pop tunes like
    "A Place In All This." This well-crafted album is unique and cohesive, revealing
    its many layers on repeated listens.
