    The second CD from San Francisco's Paddlefoot finds the band maturing as it
    roams through much of the same musical terrain as the previous CD. While this
    album occasionally rocks, it also has its introspective and bittersweet moments.
    "Neon Lights" is a romantic tribute to neon lights, "Twist Away" is a heartfelt
    song of longing and loss, and "Let the Possums Play Possum" is a instrumental romp
    that's driven by dual fiddles. If you liked the first CD, you'll like this one too.
